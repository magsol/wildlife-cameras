## 🗑️ Deprioritized Items

### YOLO Integration 🔵 LOW PRIORITY / OPTIONAL
**Status**: Relegated to distant future

**Rationale**:
- Optical flow classification is sufficient for wildlife camera use case
- YOLO requires significant computational resources (not ideal for Pi)
- Optical flow is already implemented and working
- Can revisit if users specifically request object detection

**If Implemented (Future)**:
- See `documentation/yolo_integration_plan.md` for details
- Would require YOLOv5-nano or similar lightweight model
- Integration with existing optical flow system
- Optional feature, not core functionality

## 💡 Strategic Approach

**"Deploy → Collect → Learn → Improve" Cycle**

### Week 1-2: Foundation
Deploy to hardware → Verify stability → Collect initial data

### Week 3-6: Intelligence
Analyze patterns → Train classifier → Improve UI → Deploy v2

### Week 7-10: Flexibility
Add S3 support → Test with Garage → Refine based on usage

### Week 11+: Scale
Add cameras → Advanced analytics → Community feedback

This approach leverages the solid foundation (all P1/P2 issues fixed) to quickly build intelligent, real-world capabilities while maintaining focus on actual user needs (no cloud dependency, S3-compatible option available).

## 📝 Notes

### Why S3-Compatible Storage?
- User runs self-hosted Garage (https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/)
- S3 API is well-documented and widely supported
- Enables cloud-optional deployment
- Works with AWS S3, MinIO, Garage, Ceph, and others
- No vendor lock-in

### Why Not YOLO?
- Optical flow sufficient for motion classification
- YOLO too resource-intensive for Raspberry Pi
- Not essential for wildlife camera use case
- Can revisit if community requests it

### Philosophy
- **Privacy-First**: No cloud requirement, self-hosted options
- **Resource-Conscious**: Optimized for Raspberry Pi constraints
- **Flexible**: Support multiple storage backends
- **Intelligent**: Learn from collected data
- **Reliable**: Thoroughly tested, production-ready code
