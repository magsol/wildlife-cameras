# Bug Fixes for Wildlife Camera System

This document outlines the bugs that were identified and fixed in the Raspberry Pi Wildlife Camera System.

## 1. FrameBuffer class compatibility with PiCamera2

**Bug:** The `FrameBuffer` class didn't inherit from `io.BufferedIOBase`, which is required by PiCamera2's `FileOutput` class. This caused the application to fail at startup with: `RuntimeError: Must pass io.BufferedIOBase`.

**Fix:** Made `FrameBuffer` inherit from `io.BufferedIOBase` and implemented the required interface methods:

```python
class FrameBuffer(io.BufferedIOBase):
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 5):
        super().__init__()
        self.frame = None
        self.condition = Condition()
        self.last_access_times: Dict[str, float] = {}
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.raw_frame = None
        
    # Required methods to implement BufferedIOBase interface
    def readable(self):
        return False
        
    def writable(self):
        return True
        
    def seekable(self):
        return False
        
    def flush(self):
        pass
```

## 2. Variable name error in FrameBuffer.unregister_client()

**Bug:** In the `unregister_client()` method of the `FrameBuffer` class, there was a variable name mismatch where `cid` was used instead of the correct parameter name `client_id`.

**Fix:** Changed the variable name to match the parameter name, ensuring client unregistration works correctly.

```python
def unregister_client(self, client_id: str):
    """Unregister a client"""
    with self.condition:
        if client_id in self.last_access_times:
            del self.last_access_times[client_id]  # Fixed from 'cid' to 'client_id'
```

## 2. Global variable scope issues

**Bug:** Several global variables (`prev_frame`, `motion_detected`, `motion_regions`) were being used in the `motion_storage.py` file but were only defined in the `fastapi_mjpeg_server_with_storage.py` file, causing potential scope issues.

**Fix:** Added proper global variable definitions in the `motion_storage.py` file to ensure these variables are available across modules.

```python
# Motion detection variables - initialized here for module scope
prev_frame = None
motion_detected = False
motion_regions = []
```

## 3. Hardware detection reliability

**Bug:** The code was detecting if it was running on a Raspberry Pi by checking for a specific file path (`/opt/vc/bin/raspivid`), which might not be reliable across different OS configurations or Raspberry Pi models.

**Fix:** Implemented a more robust detection method that checks multiple indicators:
- Multiple Pi-specific file paths
- Contents of `/proc/cpuinfo` for Broadcom chip identifiers
- Environment variables

```python
def is_raspberry_pi():
    """Detect if running on a Raspberry Pi using multiple methods"""
    # Method 1: Check for Pi-specific file locations
    if os.path.exists("/opt/vc/bin/raspivid") or os.path.exists("/usr/bin/vcgencmd"):
        return True
        
    # Method 2: Check CPU info
    try:
        with open("/proc/cpuinfo", "r") as f:
            cpuinfo = f.read()
            if "BCM" in cpuinfo or "Raspberry Pi" in cpuinfo:
                return True
    except Exception:
        pass
        
    # Method 3: Check for Pi-specific environment variables
    if "RASPBERRY_PI" in os.environ:
        return True
        
    # Default to false if no indicators found
    return False
```

## 4. WiFi monitoring on non-Raspberry Pi hardware

**Bug:** The WiFi monitoring feature didn't properly disable when running on non-Raspberry Pi hardware, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.

**Fix:** Updated the WiFi monitoring class to properly account for the platform and disable monitoring on non-Raspberry Pi devices:

```python
def __init__(self, config):
    self.config = config
    self.current_signal = None
    self.current_throttle = config.upload_throttle_kbps
    
    # Update WiFi availability based on platform
    global WIFI_AVAILABLE
    if not IS_RASPBERRY_PI:
        logger.info("Non-Raspberry Pi platform detected, disabling WiFi monitoring")
        WIFI_AVAILABLE = False
        
    self.enabled = config.wifi_monitoring and WIFI_AVAILABLE
```

## 5. Error handling in chunked uploads

**Bug:** Error handling in the `_upload_event_chunked` method was limited and didn't properly handle network failures, timeouts, or cleanup temporary files.

**Fix:** Implemented comprehensive error handling with:
- Timeout settings for network requests
- Proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- File validation before upload attempts
- Exception handling for all file operations
- Cleanup of failed uploads on the server side
- Detailed logging of failure modes

## 6. Thread safety improvements

**Bug:** The circular buffer class had potential thread safety issues that could lead to race conditions.

**Fix:** Improved threading safety by ensuring proper locking around critical sections and using atomic operations where possible.

## Testing

A test suite has been added to verify all bug fixes. Run it with:

```bash
python tests/test_bug_fixes.py
```

This covers all the identified issues with automated tests to ensure the fixes work as expected and will continue to work in future updates.
